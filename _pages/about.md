I am a final-year PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, Anhui, 230026, P.R. China. My supervisor is Prof. Xiang Yang Li (ACM/IEEE Fellow). My research interests span across passive internet of things, backscatter communication, and mobile/wireless sensing. My work has been published/accepted in leading conferences and journals, including ACM MobiSys, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE IWQoS, and ACM TOSN.

RESEARCH PLATFORMS
======
1. **Ultra-Low-Power Massive IoT Platform**
   - An optimal spectrum planning strategy based on linear programming enables 30 tags to communicate concurrently in a 630kHz band with 305kbps throughput. A conflict-tolerant priority scheduling technique supports 96-tag cooperation.
   - For high-bandwidth WiFi backscatter signals, partial spectrum overlap and interference cancellation enable concurrent communication of 10 tags in the 2.4GHz band.
   - Design large-scale backscatter communication protocols, combine spatial pseudo-orthogonality and OFDMA techniques to enable simulation of 9,600 tags concurrency.

2. **Robust Battery-Free Sensors Platform**
   - **Robust Sensing Platform Based on Ambient WiFi Backscatter**: Restores the original frequency band using WiFi pilot signals for single-receiver demodulation and recovers corrupted signals by detecting interference-free subcarriers, reducing FER by up to 50%.
   - **Wide-Range Passive Universal Sensing Platform**: Utilizing MOSFET transistors combined with an ultra-low-power square wave reference circuit to establish a stable relationship between RF signal parameters and sensor voltage. The prototype operates within 30 µW, with an average measurement error of less than 3%.
   - **Passive Image Signal Transmission**: Incorporating Vision Transformer-based image reconstruction algorithms to reduce transmission load by 70%.
   - **Robust Sensing Platform Based on Ambient WiFi Backscatter**: To mitigate low-frequency interference caused by drastic signal amplitude variations during tag movement, an energy balancing and dynamic demodulation algorithm is proposed, reducing the BER by 0.38.
